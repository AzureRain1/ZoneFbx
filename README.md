#ZoneFbx

ZoneFbx is a driver program and small C++/CLI library utilizing 
the FBX SDK to export FFXIV zones to FBX format, complete with textures
and proper hierarchy/object grouping.

If normal maps look weird in Blender, which they will, set the Normal node
to sRGB color space, and set the Normal/Map to World Space.
